    Explanation:
        - id passed in checkIn and checkOut: unique identifier to our customer
        - Each customer can only be checked into a station one place at a time
        
        1. Create a map called arrivals. key = id, value = tuple containing stationName and time --> (stationName, t)
        2. To keep track of all previous travels between any two stations, we create another map called travels. key = stationNames separated by a delimiter, value = count, total --> [count, total]
        
        Example:
            Calls                   Arrivals                Travels
            checkIn(1,A,3)          1 => (A,3)
            checkIn(2,A,10)         2 => (A,10)
            checkOut(1,B,5) --> look up the customer id in the arrivals map, remove the customer from arrivals map and compute the diff between start and end times
            checkOut(1,B,5)                                 A,B => (1,2)
            getAverageTime(A,B) --> combine the two stations and look it up in the travels map = 2 / 1 = 2.000000
            checkOut(2,B,20)                                A,B ==> (2,12)
            getAverageTime(A,B) --> 12 / 2 = 6
        
        TC - O(1) for all functions
        SC - O(n + m) where n is the number of arrivals and m is the number of travels. n grows larger when we have customers that check in but don't check out - we remove those entries from the arrivals map in the checkout function. m increases the more times the customers check out at various stations.

    Another example:
        
            Calls                   Arrivals                    Travels
            checkIn(45,L,3)         45 => (L,3)
            
            checkIn(32,P,8)         45 => (L,3)
                                    32 => (P,8)
            
            checkIn(27,L,10)        45 => (L,3)
                                    32 => (P,8)
                                    27 => (L,10)
                                    
            checkOut(45,W,15)       32 => (P,8)
                                    27 => (L,10)                (L,W) => (1,12)

            checkOut(32,C,22)       empty                       (P,C) => (1, 14)
            
            getAverageTime()                                    (P,C) = 14/1 = 14
            
            getAverageTime()                                    (L,W) = 22/2 = 11
            
            checkIn(10,L,24)        10 => (L,24)
        
            getAverageTime()                                    (L,W) = 22/2 = 11
            
            checkout(10,W,38)       empty                       (L,W) => (3,36)
            
            getAverageTime()                                    (L,W) = 36/3 = 12
