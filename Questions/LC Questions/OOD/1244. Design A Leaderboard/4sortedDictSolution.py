    Explanation: Using SortedDict - Balanced BST (Only works on LeetCode's Code Editor because of the sorted containers library)
        NOTE: Since there's no reverse SortedDict in Python, we will negate the scores before adding to the SortedDict so that the inorder traversal would give us the scores in descending order
        - Initialize a hashmap: key - playerId, value - score
        - Initialize a sorted map. key - score, value - number of players that have that score
        
        - addScore()
            - Note old score for the player
            - Update the old score in the sorted map. If the value is 0, remove the score entry
            - Update the dictionary with the new player score
            - Add the updated value to the sorted map as well as incrementing the value by 1. i.e. one more player has this score
            - If player doesn't exist, initialize score to score
            - TC: O(logn). BST search takes O(logn) and the addition when parent location is known is O(1)
                    
        - top() 
            - Loop over all the keys in the sorted map. Since the sorted map is a BST, then an inorder traversal of the keys would return the scores in a sorted order.
                - Pick the first k values
                    - For each key, multiply (key * value) and add it to the total sum
                    - Reduce the counter counting down to k by value
            - TC: O(k). We iterate over the keys of the sorted map and stop once we are done considering k scores
            
        - reset()
            - Note the old score for the player
            - Update the value of old score in the sorted map. If the value is 0, remove the score entry
            - Delete the entry containing the playerId
            - TC: O(log n). BST search, update and deletion take O(logn). Case is when every player has a unique score
            
        - SC: O(n). Space required by the playersToScores dictionary
